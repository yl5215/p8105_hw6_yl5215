# Problem 2

``` r
homi_data = 
  read.csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Create a city_state variable, and a binary resolved variable of
disposition. Omit data entry mistake and cities that don’t report victim
race. Only consider white and black race .

``` r
homi_data = 
  homi_data %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ", collapse = NULL)) %>%
  mutate(resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>%
  relocate(city_state) %>% 
  filter( !(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", " Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")),
    victim_race %in% c("Black", "White")) %>% 
  mutate(
    victim_race = as.factor(victim_race),
    victim_sex = as.factor(victim_sex))
```

In `resolved` variable, 1 represents “Closed by arrest”, 0 represents
“Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”.

For Baltimore, fit a logistic regression of resolved vs unresolved on
victim age, sex and race.

``` r
balt =
  homi_data %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")
fit_logistic_balt = 
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, family = binomial(), data = balt) 
```

Obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio
for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims keeping
all other variables fixed.

``` r
balt_fit = fit_logistic_balt %>% broom::tidy() 
balt_est = 
  balt_fit %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    conf_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),
    conf_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error))
balt_est
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   term         estimate std.error statistic  p.value    OR conf_lower conf_upper
    ##   <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl> <dbl>      <dbl>      <dbl>
    ## 1 victim_sexM~   -0.854     0.138     -6.18 6.26e-10 0.426      0.325      0.558

The adjusted odds ratio is estimated to be 0.4255117 with a 95%
confidence interval (0.324559, 0.5578655).

Fit a logistic regression of resolved vs unresolved on victim age, sex
and race for each city and extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for
solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims.

``` r
func = function(city) {
  city_fit = 
    glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, family = binomial(), data = city) %>%
    broom::tidy() %>% 
    mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    conf_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),
    conf_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)) %>%
    filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
    select(OR, conf_lower, conf_upper)
  return(city_fit)
}
```

``` r
city = 
  homi_data %>%
  nest(data = uid:resolved) %>%
  mutate(
    outputs = map(data, func)) %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest(outputs)
city %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

The adjusted odds ratio is mostly less than 1 in the USA indicating male
cases are harder to solve than female cases. Only Nashville, TN, Fresno,
CA, Stockton, CA, Albuquerque, NM are the exceptions where female cases
are harder to solve than male cases. The odds is the lowest in New York,
NY indicating that in New York, NY, male cases are the hardest to solve
comparing to female cases.

# Problem 3

``` r
bwt = 
  read.csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(babysex = as.factor(babysex),
         frace = as.factor(frace),
         malform = as.factor(malform),
         mrace = as.factor(mrace))
```

Propose a regression model for birthweight.

I hypothesize that birthweight is influenced by babysex (baby’s sex),
gaweeks (gestational age in weeks), malform (presence of malformations
that could affect weight), momage (mother’s age at delivery), mrace
(mother’s race), parity (number of live births prior to this pregnancy),
smoken (average number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy),
wtgain (mother’s weight gain during pregnancy). Therefore, these
variables are chosen as predictors in the regrassion model.

``` r
fit1 = lm(bwt ~ babysex + gaweeks + malform + momage + mrace + parity + smoken + wtgain, data = bwt)
summary(fit1)
```

momage, malform, and parity are removed because they are insignificant.

``` r
fit = lm(bwt ~ babysex + gaweeks + mrace + smoken + wtgain, data = bwt)

Predictors chosen are babysex, gaweeks, mrace, smoken, and wtgain.

The model fits well because observations seem evenly distributed around
y=0.

Compare my model to two other models in terms of the cross-validated

My model has the largest RMSE indicating the model gives the worse fit.
The model using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
has the lowest RMSE indicating the model gives the best fit.

The result indicates that infant birth data (bhead, blength) are
important in predicting birthweight and should be included when
available.
